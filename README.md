## Installation  
Clone repo and npm i  
## Usage  
This application is launched through the command line ("node index.js").  Once launched, the user is prompted for the following information about the manager of the team:
* Manager's name
* Employee ID
* Email address
* Office number  

Once the user has entered this information about the manager, they are presented with a main menu with the following options:
* Add an engineer
* Add an intern
* Finish building my team  

If the user selects the *Add an engineer* option, they are prompted to enter the following information:
* Engineer's name
* Employee ID
* Email address
* GitHub username

Once the user has entered this information about the engineer, they are presented with the main menu once again and may proceed to add another engineer, intern, or finish building their team.  

If the user selects the *Add an intern* option, they are prompted to enter the following information:
* Intern's name
* Employee ID
* Email address
* School  

Once the user has entered this information about the intern, they are presented with the main menu once again and may proceed to add another engineer, intern, or finish building their team.  

If the user selects the *Finish building my team* option, an *index.html* file is generated in the dist folder.  The user can then open that file in their default web browser to view their team profile page.
